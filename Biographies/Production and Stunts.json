        "text": "For Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, producer\u2013director Leonard Nimoy and the film\u2019s creative team wanted the Klingons to have a more fully realized, distinctive language rather than improvised sounds. Okrand was hired to construct that language from the ground up. Drawing on a few previously established Klingon phrases and his own knowledge of phonology and syntax, he devised a harsh, guttural sound system and an unusual word order that would feel alien yet speakable by human actors. The result was tlhIngan Hol\u2014Klingon\u2014as fans know it today."

He chose an object\u2013verb\u2013subject (OVS) basic word order, which is extremely rare in Earth\u2019s languages, to make the structure feel unfamiliar to human ears. He combined sounds that are rare or difficult in many languages, added complex verb prefixes and suffixes that encode subject and object information, and created vocabulary that often reflected Klingon culture and values. The goal was not just to produce exotic noises, but to build a functional, internally consistent language that could be extended over time."

His involvement continued across several Star Trek movies, including Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, where he also contributed to additional Vulcan and other alien-language dialogue as needed."

The book laid out the sounds, grammar, and vocabulary of Klingon in a systematic way and quickly became a cornerstone of fan engagement with the language. He followed it with works such as The Klingon Way: A Warrior\u2019s Guide and Klingon for the Galactic Traveler, which expanded vocabulary, offered proverbs and cultural notes, and further deepened the sense that Klingon was a living language with its own worldview."

Okrand\u2019s work made it possible for fans to hold conversations, stage plays, translate works of literature, and even sing songs in Klingon. Organizations like the Klingon Language Institute emerged to support learning and to explore the language\u2019s possibilities, often consulting Okrand\u2019s books and occasional new material from him to keep their usage aligned with the original design."

One notable project was Atlantean, the language he developed for Disney\u2019s animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire. As with Klingon, he drew on real-world linguistic typology to design a language that felt internally coherent and tied to the fictional culture portrayed on screen.

Even when other linguists have been brought in for later productions, they typically treat Okrand\u2019s system as the canonical core, building new words and expressions to fit within the framework he established.

Klingon has been studied in classrooms, used in academic discussions of linguistics, and embraced by fans as both a playful challenge and a serious object of study. For the franchise, his work added depth and authenticity to one of its central alien cultures; for the broader world of language creation, he demonstrated how a constructed tongue made for film could evolve into a rich, ongoing linguistic tradition."

On Deep Space Nine he helped contrast Starfleet design with Cardassian architecture and iconography, while on Voyager he emphasized the sleek, compact design of a long-range exploratory vessel.

He leaned into the idea of the Enterprise as a starship with a chain of command, uniforms that felt more naval, and battles staged like submarine duels rather than abstract energy exchanges. He also infused the film with literary touches, from Moby-Dick quotations to parallels with classic revenge tragedies, giving Khan a mythic intensity while grounding the story in clearly defined stakes and tactics."

The death of Spock in the film\u2019s climax was staged as a quiet, emotional sacrifice rather than a spectacle, allowing the Kirk\u2013Spock\u2013McCoy triangle to reach a poignant culmination.
