McCoy is able to keep Spock's body alive with an experimental device, but they must recover his brain within hours. Tracking the raider to the Sigma Draconis system, the crew discovers that Spock's brain has been installed as the 'Controller' of an underground civilization of Eymorg women who rely on ancient technology they no longer understand.",

In sickbay, McCoy confirms that the brain has been removed with extreme surgical precision that exceeds normal Starfleet medical capabilities."

Evidence of advanced technology leads the landing party into an underground complex inhabited by the Eymorg, a community of women who live in comfort, guided by a central intelligence they call the Controller.
