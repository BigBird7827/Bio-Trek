      "overview": "A delirious Dr. McCoy accidentally hurls himself through a time portal on a ruined world, changing history so completely that the Federation is erased and the Enterprise never existed. \nTo repair the timeline, Kirk and Spock follow him through the Guardian of Forever and land in Depression\u2011era New York, where they struggle to survive with no equipment, no records of the past, and only Spock\u2019s damaged tricorder to guide them. \nWhile living at a mission run by the compassionate social worker Edith Keeler, Kirk falls deeply in love with her, even as Spock\u2019s repaired recordings slowly reveal that Edith\u2019s idealistic pacifism will inadvertently delay the United States\u2019 entry into World War II and allow fascism to win. \nIn the end, Kirk realizes that history can only be restored if Edith dies as she originally did, forcing him to stop McCoy from saving her and endure the personal cost of letting the woman he loves be killed to save the future.

Dr. McCoy administers cordrazine, a powerful stimulant, to stabilize him, but a jolt throws McCoy into his own hypospray, injecting himself with a massive overdose. Moments later, he is staggering and paranoid, seeing enemies everywhere. Panicking, he escapes security and beams down to the planet\u2019s surface, already under the influence of the mind-altering drug."

As the Guardian plays rapid images of Earth\u2019s past, McCoy bursts from hiding, rants about assassins from the future, and dives through the portal. The Guardian goes silent. Uhura discovers she has lost contact with the Enterprise\u2014and then realizes the ship no longer exists. History has been changed in the instant McCoy entered the past."

They leap through the Guardian and appear in the middle of a bustling 1930s New York street, narrowly avoiding traffic. Their Starfleet uniforms draw attention, forcing them to steal clothes from a fire escape and flee from the police. They duck into the basement of a mission, where they are discovered by Edith Keeler, a compassionate social worker who assumes they are down-on-their-luck drifters. She offers them work and lodging in exchange for honest labor, while Kirk improvises a cover story and Spock quietly begins plotting how to rebuild enough technology to analyze the timeline."

She gives hopeful speeches about a future where poverty is eliminated, humanity reaches for the stars, and peace is pursued instead of war. Her ideals sound eerily like the Federation\u2019s values, and Kirk begins to wonder if fate has led him to the perfect person in the wrong time. Meanwhile, Spock cobbles together a makeshift computer from 1930s components and the tricorder circuits he smuggled into the past. After several attempts, he finally reconstructs enough historical data to see what McCoy will change: in the original timeline, Edith Keeler dies in a traffic accident; in the altered timeline, McCoy arrives in time to save her, enabling her peace movement to delay U.S. entry into World War II long enough for Nazi Germany to prevail. Her survival leads to a future where the Federation never forms."

A concerned woman and a policeman try to help, but he bolts and eventually collapses near Edith\u2019s mission, where she takes him in and gets him medical care. Once the cordrazine delirium fades, McCoy returns to himself and is horrified by his situation, yet has no idea he has shattered the future. When he finally crosses paths with Kirk and Spock at the mission, the reunion is joyous\u2014but Kirk already knows what must happen. Later, as they all walk together, Edith steps into the street, distracted by conversation, and a truck barrels toward her. McCoy instinctively moves to pull her out of the way. Kirk, frozen by knowledge, lunges instead for McCoy, restraining him as the truck strikes Edith and kills her."

Kirk, clearly shattered, rejects any philosophical comfort.

Stripped of his uniform and status, Picard is subjected to a regimen of physical pain, sleep deprivation, and psychological manipulation. Madred\u2019s signature tactic is deceptively simple: he shines a set of lights and insists there are five, when there are in fact four, punishing Picard whenever he refuses to agree. The goal is not just to extract military information but to force Picard into accepting a lie, thereby demonstrating the Cardassians\u2019 ability to control even a Starfleet legend. Between sessions, Madred taunts Picard with stories about his own upbringing and Cardassian strength, trying to wear down his sense of self."

Scans reveal a civilization roughly equivalent to 21st-century Earth that has nonetheless developed warp-level technology\u2014not for exploration, but as a superweapon. The cause is traced back to a side effect of the massive battle near the planet\u2019s system seen in Discovery\u2019s finale; the inhabitants observed the exotic energy signatures and reverse-engineered them into a destructive device. Pike and a small team undergo genetic alteration to pass as natives and beam down, where they discover that Una and her people have been imprisoned as spies amid a simmering civil conflict."

He decides to openly reveal his identity and the existence of the Federation to the planet\u2019s leaders, a move that breaks normal protocol but might be the only way to stop a war."

He frames the choice before them not as a moral lecture from superior beings but as a warning drawn from lived experience: use warp power as a weapon and risk annihilation, or choose a harder path toward peace and eventual membership in a broader community. The gambit works; the world steps back from the brink and expresses interest in peaceful contact. Returning to the Enterprise, Pike admits to himself that he cannot run from his fate but can decide what to do with the years he has left, embracing his role as captain despite the shadow of what is to come."
